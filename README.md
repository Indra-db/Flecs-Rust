Hello there! Welcome to my Rust wrapper around the ECS library called [Flecs](https://github.com/SanderMertens/flecs). This project endeavors to offer Rust developers an intuitive and streamlined interface to harness the full potential of Flecs, the most advanced open source Entity Component System (ECS) library available today.

## ⚠️ Status: Alpha release happening mid June

The project is at a stage where the **core functionality** of Flecs has been **ported successfully** and is available to use today. While you're encouraged to explore, test, and provide feedback, please be aware of potential bugs and breaking changes as we continue to refine the API and add new features.

This library has not been advertized nor published yet on crates.io or other platforms until it's ready for a full alpha release.

### The progress

For detailed feature progress, please visit the [issues](https://github.com/Indra-db/flecs-ecs-rs/issues) page.


- [x] Core library ![](https://geps.dev/progress/100?dangerColor=800000&warningColor=ff9900&successColor=006600)
- [ ] Addons ![](https://geps.dev/progress/45?dangerColor=800000&warningColor=ff9900&successColor=006600) (most important ones are done!) + Rules
- [ ] Documentation ![](https://geps.dev/progress/70?dangerColor=800000&warningColor=ff9900&successColor=006600) codebase documented with C++ alias. missing 30% is adding Rust syntax to Flecs docs site.
- [ ] Test suite ![](https://geps.dev/progress/30?dangerColor=800000&warningColor=ff9900&successColor=006600) (entity operations + query operations are fully tested)
- [ ] Examples ![](https://geps.dev/progress/70?dangerColor=800000&warningColor=ff9900&successColor=006600)[Click me for more info](https://github.com/Indra-db/flecs-ecs-rs/issues/12) - of the current supported features, all examples are done ✔️

## The Aim

The plan is to match feature parity of the C++ API, starting with the core library (done!) while also being fully documented and tested.
