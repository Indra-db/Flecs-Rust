// Prefabs are entities that can be used as templates for other entities. They
// are created with a builtin Prefab tag, which by default excludes them from
// queries and systems.
//
// Prefab instances are entities that have an IsA relationship to the prefab.
// The IsA relationship causes instances to inherit the components from the
// prefab. By default all instances for a prefab share its components.
//
// Inherited components save memory as they only need to be stored once for all
// prefab instances. They also speed up the creation of prefabs, as inherited
// components don't need to be copied to the instances.
//
// To get a private copy of a component, an instance can add it which is called
// an override. Overrides can be manual (by using add) or automatic (see the
// auto_override example).
//
// If a prefab has children, adding the IsA relationship instantiates the prefab
// children for the instance (see hierarchy example).

    // component with the prefab, and can be retrieved as a regular component:
    inst.try_get::<&Defence>(|d_inst| {
        println!("{:?}", d_inst);
        // Because the component is shared, changing the value on the prefab will
        // also change the value for the instance:
        // this is safe during a table lock because it also has the component and won't cause the table to move.
