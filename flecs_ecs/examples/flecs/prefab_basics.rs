// Prefabs are entities that can be used as templates for other entities. They
// are created with a builtin Prefab tag, which by default excludes them from
// queries and systems.
//
// Prefab instances are entities that have an IsA relationship to the prefab.
// The IsA relationship causes instances to inherit the components from the
// prefab. By default all instances for a prefab share its components.
//
// Inherited components save memory as they only need to be stored once for all
// prefab instances. They also speed up the creation of prefabs, as inherited
// components don't need to be copied to the instances.
//
// To get a private copy of a component, an instance can add it which is called
// an override. Overrides can be manual (by using add) or automatic (see the
// auto_override example).
//
// If a prefab has children, adding the IsA relationship instantiates the prefab
// children for the instance (see hierarchy example).

    // component with the prefab, and can be retrieved as a regular component:
    let d_inst = inst.try_get::<Defence>().unwrap();

    // Because the component is shared, changing the value on the prefab will
    // also change the value for the instance:
    spaceship.set(Defence { value: 100.0 });
    fprintln!(&world, "after set: {:?}", d_inst);

    // Prefab components can be iterated like regular components:
