    bob.add_first::<Likes>(jane); // inserting a bit of drama

    // The following rule will only return entities that have a cyclic Likes
    // relationship- that is they must both like each other.
    //
    // The equivalent query in the DSL is:
    //   Likes($X, $Y), Likes($Y, $X)
    //
    // This is also an example of a query where all sources are variables. By
    // default queries use the builtin "This" variable as subject, which is what
    // populates the entities array in the query result (accessed by the
    // iter::entity function).
    //
    // Because this query does not use This at all, the entities array will not
    // be populated, and it.count() will always be 0.

    let rule = world
        .query::<()>()
        .with_first_name::<&Likes>(c"$Y")
        .set_src_name(c"$X")
        .with_first_name::<&Likes>(c"$X")
        .set_src_name(c"$Y")
        .build();

    // Lookup the index of the variables. This will let us quickly lookup their
    // values while we're iterating.
    let x_var = rule.find_var(c"X").unwrap();
    let y_var = rule.find_var(c"Y").unwrap();

    // Because the query doesn't use the This variable we cannot use "each"
    // which iterates the entities array. Instead we can use iter like this:
    rule.iter_only(|it| {
        let x = it.get_var(x_var);
        let y = it.get_var(y_var);
        fprintln!(it, "{} likes {}", x.name(), y.name());
    });

    world
        .get::<Snap>()
        .test("rules_cyclic_variables".to_string());

    // Output:
    //  Alice likes Bob
    //  John likes Jane
    //  Jane likes John
    //  Bob likes Alice

    // Note that the rule returns each pair twice. The reason for this is that
    // the goal of the rule engine is to return all "facts" that are true
    // within the given constraints. Since we did not give it any constraints
    // that would favor a person being matched by X or Y, the rule engine
    // returns both.
