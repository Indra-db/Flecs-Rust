// Prefabs are entities that can be used as templates for other entities. They
// are created with a builtin Prefab tag, which by default excludes them from
// queries and systems.
//
// Prefab instances are entities that have an IsA relationship to the prefab.
// The IsA relationship causes instances to inherit the components from the
// prefab. By default all instances for a prefab share its components.
//
// Inherited components save memory as they only need to be stored once for all
// prefab instances. They also speed up the creation of prefabs, as inherited
// components don't need to be copied to the instances.
//
// To get a private copy of a component, an instance can add it which is called
// an override. Overrides can be manual (by using add) or automatic (see the
// auto_override example).
//
// If a prefab has children, adding the IsA relationship instantiates the prefab
// children for the instance (see hierarchy example).

#[derive(Debug, Component)]

fn main() {
    let world = World::new();

    // Create a prefab with Position and Velocity components
    let spaceship = world.prefab_named(c"Prefab").set(Defence { value: 50.0 });

    // Create a prefab instance
    let inst = world.new_entity_named(c"my_spaceship").is_a_id(spaceship);

    // Because of the IsA relationship, the instance now shares the Defense
    // component with the prefab, and can be retrieved as a regular component:
    let d_inst = inst.get::<Defence>().unwrap();
    println!("{:?}", d_inst);

    // Because the component is shared, changing the value on the prefab will
    // also change the value for the instance:
    spaceship.set(Defence { value: 100.0 });
    println!("after set: {:?}", d_inst);

    // Prefab components can be iterated like regular components:
    world.each_entity::<&Defence>(|entity, d| {
        println!("{}: {}", entity.path().unwrap(), d.value);
    });

    // Output:
    //  Defence { value: 50.0 }
    //  after set: Defence { value: 100.0 }
    //  ::my_spaceship: 100
