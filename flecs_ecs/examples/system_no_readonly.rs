// When an application calls world.progress(), the world is put in readonly mode.
// This ensures that systems (on multiple threads) can safely iterate
// components, without having to worry about components moving around while
// they're being read. This has as side effect that any operations (like adding
// or removing components) are not visible until the end of the frame (see the
// sync_point example for more details).
// Sometimes this is not what you want, and you need a change to be visible
// immediately. For these use cases, applications can use a no_readonly system.
// This temporarily takes the world out of readonly mode, so a system can make
// changes that are directly visible.
// Because they mutate the world directly, no_readonly systems are never ran on
// more than one thread, and no other systems are ran at the same time.
