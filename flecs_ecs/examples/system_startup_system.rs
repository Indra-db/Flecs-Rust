// Startup systems are systems registered with the EcsOnStart phase, and are
// only ran during the first frame. Just like with regular phases, custom phases
// can depend on the EcsOnStart phase (see custom_phases example). Phases that
// depend on EcsOnStart are also only ran during the first frame.
//
// Other than that, startup systems behave just like regular systems (they can
// match components, can introduce merge points), with as only exception that
// they are guaranteed to always run on the main thread.
