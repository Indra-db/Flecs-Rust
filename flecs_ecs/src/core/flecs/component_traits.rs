///

/// Cleanup traits ensure that the store does not contain any dangling references when entities are deleted.
///
/// When entities that are used as tags, components, relationships or relationship targets are deleted,
/// cleanup traits ensure that the store does not contain any dangling references. Any cleanup policy
/// provides this guarantee, so while they are configurable, applications cannot configure traits that
/// allow for dangling references.
///
/// **Note**: this only applies to entities (like tags, components, relationships) that are added _to_
/// other entities. It does not apply to components that store an entity value, so:
///
/// ```no_run
/// # use flecs_ecs::prelude::*;
/// # let world = World::new();
/// # let parent = world.entity();
/// # let e = world.entity();
/// #[derive(Component)]
/// struct MyComponent {
///     e: Entity, // Not covered by cleanup traits
/// }
///
/// e.child_of(parent); // Covered by cleanup traits
/// ```
///
/// The default policy is that any references to the entity will be **removed**. For example, when the
/// tag `Archer` is deleted, it will be removed from all entities that have it. Which is similar to invoking
/// the [`World::remove_all()`](flecs_ecs::core::World::remove_all) method.
///
/// Since entities can be used in relationship pairs, just calling `remove_all` on just the entity itself
/// does not guarantee that no dangling references are left. A more comprehensive description of what happens is:
///
/// ```
/// # use flecs_ecs::prelude::*;
/// # let world = World::new();
/// # let archer = world.entity();
/// world.remove_all(archer);
/// world.remove_all((archer, flecs::Wildcard));
/// world.remove_all((flecs::Wildcard, archer));
/// ```
///
/// This succeeds in removing all possible references to `Archer`. Sometimes this behavior is not what we want however.
/// Consider a parent-child hierarchy, where we want to delete the child entities when the parent is deleted.
/// Instead of removing `(ChildOf, parent)` from all children, we need to *delete* the children.
///
/// We also want to specify this per relationship. If an entity has `(Likes, parent)` we may not want to delete that entity,
/// meaning the cleanup we want to perform for `Likes` and `ChildOf` may not be the same.
///
/// This is what cleanup traits are for: to specify which action needs to be executed under which condition.
/// They are applied *to* entities that have a reference to the entity being deleted:
/// if I delete the `Archer` tag I remove the tag *from* all entities that have it.
///
/// To configure a cleanup policy for an entity, a `(Condition, Action)` pair can be added to it.
/// If no policy is specified, the default cleanup action (`Remove`) is performed.
///
/// There are three cleanup actions:
/// - [`Remove`]: as if doing `remove_all(entity)` (default)
/// - [`Delete`]: as if doing `delete_with(entity)`
/// - [`Panic`]: throw a fatal error (default for components)
///
/// There are two cleanup conditions:
/// - [`OnDelete`]: the component, tag or relationship is deleted
/// - [`OnDeleteTarget`]: a target used with the relationship is deleted
///
/// Policies apply to both regular and pair instances, so to all entities with `T` as well as `(T, *)`.
///
/// # Cleanup order
///
/// While cleanup actions allow for specifying what needs to happen when a particular entity is deleted,
/// or when an entity used with a particular relationship is deleted, they do not enforce a strict cleanup *order*.
/// The reason for this is that there can be many orderings that satisfy the cleanup traits.
///
/// This is important to consider especially when writing `OnRemove` triggers or hooks,
/// as the order in which they are invoked highly depends on the order in which entities are cleaned up.
///
/// Take an example with a parent and a child that both have the `Node` tag:
///
/// ```rust
/// # use flecs_ecs::prelude::*;
/// # #[derive(Component)]
/// # struct Node;
/// # let world = World::new();
/// world
///     .observer::<flecs::OnRemove, ()>()
///     .with(Node)
///     .each_entity(|e, _| {
///         // This observer will be invoked when a Node is removed
///     });
///
/// let p = world.entity().add(Node);
/// let c = world.entity().add(Node).child_of(p);
/// ```
///
/// In this example, when calling `p.destruct()` the observer is first invoked for the child, and then for the parent,
/// which is to be expected as the child is deleted before the parent.
/// Cleanup traits do not however guarantee that this is always the case.
///
/// An application could also call `world.component::<Node>().destruct()` which would delete the `Node` component and
/// all of its instances. In this scenario the cleanup traits for the `flecs::ChildOf` relationship are not considered,
/// and therefore the ordering is undefined. Another typical scenario in which ordering is undefined is when an application
/// has cyclical relationships with a `Delete` cleanup action.
///
/// #### Cleanup order during world teardown
/// Cleanup issues often show up during world teardown as the ordering in which entities are deleted is controlled by the application.
/// While world teardown respects cleanup traits, there can be many entity delete orderings that are valid according to the cleanup traits,
/// but not all of them are equally useful. There are ways to organize entities that helps world cleanup to do the right thing. These are:
///
/// **Organize components, triggers, observers and systems in modules.**
/// Storing these entities in modules ensures that they stay alive for as long as possible.
/// This leads to more predictable cleanup ordering as components will be deleted as their entities are,
/// vs. when the component is deleted. It also ensures that triggers and observers are not deleted while matching events are still being generated.
///
/// **Avoid organizing components, triggers, observers and systems under entities that are not modules**.
/// If a non-module entity with children is stored in the root, it will get cleaned up along with other regular entities.
/// If you have entities such as these organized in a non-module scope, consider adding the `flecs::Module` tag to the root of that scope.
///
/// The next section goes into more detail on why this improves cleanup behavior and what happens during world teardown.
///
/// #### World teardown sequence
/// To understand why some ways to organize entities work better than others, having an overview of what happens during world teardown is useful.
/// Here is a list of the steps that happen when a world is deleted:
///
/// 1. **Find all root entities**
///    World teardown starts by finding all root entities, which are entities that do not have the builtin `ChildOf` relationship.
///    Note that empty entities (entities without any components) are not found during this step.
///
/// 2. **Query out modules, components, observers and systems**
///    This ensures that components are not cleaned up before the entities that use them, and triggers,
///    observers and systems are not cleaned up while there are still conditions under which they could be invoked.
///
/// 3. **Query out entities that have no children**
///    If entities have no children they cannot cause complex cleanup logic. This also decreases the likelihood of initiating cleanup actions that could impact other entities.
///
/// 4. **Delete root entities**
///    The root entities that were not filtered out will be deleted.
///
/// 5. **Delete everything else**
///    The last step will delete all remaining entities. At this point cleanup traits are no longer considered and cleanup order is undefined.
