//! Flecs is a fast and lightweight Entity Component System that lets you build games and simulations with millions of entities.
//!
//! This library provides a comprehensive and low-overhead Rust binding for [Flecs](https://github.com/SanderMertens/flecs) an ECS written in C.
//!
//! ## Documentation
//!
//! - The **[flecs.dev](https://www.flecs.dev/)** website contains comprehensive documentation on Flecs on its features & how to use it for Rust and other languages.
//! - **[Component Macro](component_macro/index.html)** - Complete guide to the `#[derive(Component)]` macro and all its attributes.
//! - **[DSL Macro](dsl/index.html)** - Query, system, and observer DSL documentation
//!
//! ## Safety
//!
//! This crate enables additional runtime checks by default to preserve Rust's
//! borrowing and concurrency guarantees when calling into the underlying C
//! Flecs library. Those checks are provided by the `flecs_safety_locks` feature
//! (enabled by default) and help prevent unsafe aliasing and concurrent mutable
//! access across Flecs callbacks, systems and queries.
//!
//! These safety checks imposes a runtime cost. If you fully understand the
//! characteristics of your application and need maximum performance,
//! you may disable `flecs_safety_locks` (e.g. for a Release). Disabling it will
//! improve throughput but removes the runtime protections and may lead to
//! undefined behavior if the API is used in an unsafe way. This might or might not matter
//! depending on the application.
